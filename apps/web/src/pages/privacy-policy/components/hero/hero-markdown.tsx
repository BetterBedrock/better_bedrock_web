That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processor, Stripe, whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy.

* **Email Addresses:** We retain the email addresses of customers for our records and to assist with any potential customer service inquiries related to voucher delivery.
* **IP Addresses:** IP addresses used for download validation are retained for a short period to prevent abuse and then are permanently deleted.

### 6. Data Security

We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
