  },
  {
    question: "What are the expected earnings?",
    answer:
      "Creators average €8.5 per 1000 downloads. Through our Linkvertise ADs integration, high-quality traffic can reach up to $70 CPM, depending on user location and engagement.",
  },
  {
    question: "How effective is the Anti-bypass system?",
    answer:
      "Our scripts actively block common bypass tools. This ensures that users must complete the required steps, preventing 'revenue leaks' and increasing your total profit.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the requirements for withdrawal?",
    answer:
      "All earnings go directly to your Linkvertise account. You only need to integrate your account via the User ID and Token in our dashboard—no middleman, no extra fees here.",

    question: "Pro Tip: How to avoid unnecessary fees?",

  {
    question: "Is using Better Bedrock safe for my account?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Our platform only manages the download redirection and protection layer. We never request your Microsoft credentials, and our system complies with standard third-party content distribution practices.",
  },
  {
    question: "Account Safety & TOS Compliance",
    answer:
      "We operate independently of your Minecraft account. Using Better Bedrock doesn't violate Microsoft's EULA for creators, as you are simply managing the distribution of your own original content.",
  },
  {
    question: "What projects can I upload?",
    answer:
      "You can monetize any original Minecraft Bedrock content, including Texture/Resource/Behavior Packs, Addons, Scripts, Maps/Worlds and Skin Packs. Please ensure you own the rights to the files you distribute.",
  },
  {
    question: "Troubleshooting broken links",
    answer:
      "Most issues stem from incorrect User ID or Token configuration. Double-check your settings against the tutorial. If the problem persists, contact us on Discord.",
  },
  {
    question: "Device Compatibility",
    answer:
      "Better Bedrock links work across all platforms (Android, iOS, Windows). While console users can't always easily download custom content, the links themselves remain accessible via any mobile or desktop browser.",
  },
  {
    question: "Transparency: Better Bedrock vs. Creator Earnings",
    answer:
      "Our revenue system is separate from yours. While we use an internal gateway for our own services, all creator earnings come directly from Linkvertise ads, ensuring no hidden fees or middleman cuts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sell my addons for a fixed price?",
    answer:
      "Currently, we only support ad-based monetization. This allows your content to remain free for users while you earn revenue. Direct sales (Premium Marketplace) are a planned feature for future updates.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Better Bedrock take a cut from my earnings?",
    answer:
      "No. We do not take any percentage from your Linkvertise revenue. 100% of what you earn through ads goes directly to your Linkvertise wallet without any intervention from our side.",
  },
