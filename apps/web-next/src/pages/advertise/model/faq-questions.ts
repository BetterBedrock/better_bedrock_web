    answer: "By placing ads on high-traffic, high-intent subpages like \"Download\" and \"Projects\" (~60% of traffic), we maximize the chance of conversion. You can monitor performance in real-time through our dashboard, tracking Views, Clicks, and CTR."

  {
    question: "How can I pay for my campaign?",

    question: "What are the banner requirements?",
    answer: "To maintain high visual standards, we require a fixed 8:2 aspect ratio. Banners should be delivered in 1200x300 px or 1600x400 px resolutions to ensure HD quality. We accept PNG, JPG, and animated GIFs, provided the file size does not exceed 1/3 MB to ensure fast loading times."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the \"Anti-Bypass\" (AdBlock Resistance) work?",
    answer: "Our advertising system is built directly into the site’s native architecture rather than using external tracking scripts. Internal tests show that our banners remain visible in 99% of cases, even for users with active filters like uBlock Origin."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my banner graphics after the campaign starts?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer campaign flexibility. You can update your creative assets at any time during the emission period, provided the new graphics pass our technical verification regarding the 8:2 ratio and file size limits."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will my campaign go live?",
    answer: "Once your payment is processed and your graphics are approved, your ad will be deployed within 0-48 hours. Please note that setups during weekends may take slightly longer."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any content restrictions or refund options?",
    answer: "We maintain a strict No-Refund Policy once the campaign has launched due to the reservation of limited ad space. We also reserve the right to reject content promoting gambling, scams, or NSFW material to keep our community safe."
